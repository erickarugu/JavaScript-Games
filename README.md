## Inspiration
I believe that creating games is a great way to solidify any programming knowledge where applicable. Creating a game involves a lot of thinking to meet the various rules involved in playing it.
It is for this reason that I try to create every simple popular game I know and play. I have found it to be so fun. I hope you will join me
